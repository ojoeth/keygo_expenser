# KeyGo Expenser
This script is something I threw together while reverse engineering the Southern Rail [KeyGo](https://www.southernrailway.com/tickets/the-key-smartcard/keygo) API.

The idea is that you input a year, month, and optionally a destination station to filter results, then log in to Southern's API using the prompt, and it will spit out a crude HTML file with some CSS train tickets containing information about your journeys, possibly allowing you to make expensing train travel a little easier.
